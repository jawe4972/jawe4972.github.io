Result
Below is an 11‑week timeline that spreads the approximately 45 total work hours (roughly 4 hours per week) into manageable tasks. The outline emphasizes building a minimum viable product (MVP) first, then iterating on features like predictive analytics, secure authentication, and containerization. Adjust the time allocation as needed based on your progress and challenges.

Week 1 – Project Planning & Setup (4 hours)
Define Scope & Architecture:
Clarify requirements and features (expense tracking, data visualizations, predictive analytics, REST API, authentication, Docker, documentation).
Sketch a high-level architecture (client-server separation, tech stack choices, and libraries).
Repository & Tooling Setup:
Initialize a Git repository.
Create a rough project plan with milestones and basic wireframes.
Environment Preparation:
Set up your development environment (Python/JavaScript frameworks, database, etc.).


Week 2 – Backend Skeleton and Expense CRUD (4 hours)
Design Data Models & API Framework:
Define the data model for expenses (e.g., date, amount, category, description).
Set up a RESTful API framework (e.g., Flask, Django, or FastAPI).
Implement Basic CRUD Endpoints:
Develop endpoints for Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for expenses.
Local Testing:
Write simple tests or use a tool like Postman to verify API endpoints.


Week 3 – Database Integration & API Refinement (4 hours)
Database Setup:
Choose and configure your database (e.g., SQLite for simplicity or PostgreSQL).
Integrate database operations within your API.
Enhance Expense Endpoints:
Ensure that the CRUD operations are fully connected to the database.
Error Handling & Validation:
Add basic input validation and error handling for API endpoints.


Week 4 – Frontend Skeleton & Dashboard Layout (4 hours)
Initial Frontend Setup:
Set up the frontend project structure (React, Vue, or plain HTML/JS).
Develop Main Dashboard UI:
Create a basic layout that includes sections for expense listing, charts, and predictions.
Integrate with Backend:
Implement a preliminary connection (AJAX/fetch API) to call the backend endpoints for expense tracking.


Week 5 – Data Visualization Integration (4 hours)
Visualization Setup:
Choose a library (e.g., Chart.js for simplicity as a mitigation strategy over D3.js).
Implement Basic Charts:
Create at least two visualization types: one for expense trends and one for spending category breakdowns.
Data Integration:
Connect charts to the API data, even if using mock data initially.


Week 6 – Predictive Analytics (4 hours)
Feature Scope for Analytics:
Plan to implement a 30‑day cash flow forecast using simple time series forecasting (e.g., moving average or linear regression).
Develop Predictive Module:
Implement the initial version of the forecasting logic using Python libraries (like Pandas, NumPy, or scikit‑learn).
Testing with Mock Data:
Validate the forecast on sample data to ensure it produces reasonable outputs.


Week 7 – Enhance Predictive Analytics & Data Flow (4 hours)
Refinement of Forecasting:
Fine-tune the model to meet the performance goal (e.g., MAE < $100 on test data).
Integration into Dashboard:
Display the cash flow forecast within the dashboard UI.
Simulated Deployments & Evaluation:
Test the end-to-end flow with fake and then more realistic data to see how predictions reflect expense trends.


Week 8 – Secure User Authentication and API Finalization (4 hours)
Authentication Implementation:
Implement secure user authentication (choose JWT or session-based).
Add endpoints for user registration and login.
Integrate with Existing Modules:
Ensure that expense tracking and forecasting endpoints require authentication.
Security Testing:
Do some basic testing (and maybe code reviews) to verify secure data handling.


Week 9 – Docker Containerization (4 hours)
Containerize the Application:
Write Dockerfiles for both backend and frontend.
Optionally, create a docker-compose file to orchestrate multi‑container setup (backend, frontend, DB).
Testing the Container:
Run the containers locally and ensure that the app runs as expected.
Debug & Document Container Setup:
Make sure to capture common issues and steps in the documentation.


Week 10 – Documentation and Testing (4 hours)
Write Comprehensive Documentation:
Document the project architecture, API endpoints, and instructions for setup/deployment.
Include guidelines on using the predictive analytics and dashboard features.
Implement Testing:
Write unit tests for critical components (CRUD operations, predictive module, authentication).
Create basic integration tests to ensure end-to-end flow.
Review & Refine:
Go through the documentation and code to verify clarity and completeness.


Week 11 – Final Testing, Bug Fixes, and Polishing (4 hours)
Conduct Full End-to-End Testing:
Test all user flows—from registration and expense entry to viewing visualizations and predictions.
Bug Fixes & Enhancements:
Address any bugs or performance issues discovered during testing.
Fine-tune the UI/UX for clarity and responsiveness.
