Provide a weekly update on your progress and your thoughts about what you are working on. This will be posted to both the discussion forum (Piazza) and kept as an entry on your personal web page. The format of the post should follow the Agile standup meeting format that asks the following questions: 
What did you do last week?
What do you plan to do this week?
Are there any impediments in your way?
Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
