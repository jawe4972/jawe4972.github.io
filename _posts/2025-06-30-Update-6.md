# Weekly Update #6

## What did you do last week? 
Chose a library Chart.js
Implemented basic charts (still shooting for a few visualization types: one for expense trends and one for spending category breakdowns)
Attempted to connect charts to the API data

## Are there any impediments in your way?
* More technical stuff. Getting up to speed on this has been tough

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* Same as last week, continuing to work on one thing at a time to maintain focus and staying organized 

## Plans for this week?
Feature Scope for Analytics:
Plan to implement a 30‑day cash flow forecast using simple time series forecasting (e.g., moving average or linear regression).
Develop Predictive Module:
Implement the initial version of the forecasting logic using Python libraries (like Pandas, NumPy, or scikit‑learn).
Testing with Mock Data:
Validate the forecast on sample data to ensure it produces reasonable outputs.
