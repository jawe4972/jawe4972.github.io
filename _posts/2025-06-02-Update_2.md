# Weekly Update #2
## What did you do last week?
* Arranged the website for the project and attempted to clarify requirements and features (expense tracking, data visualizations, predictive analytics, REST API, authentication, Docker, documentation). I also designed a high-level architecture (client-server separation, tech stack choices, and libraries).

## What do you plan to do this week?
* Design Data Models & API Framework
* Define the data model for expenses (e.g., date, amount, category, description).
* Set up a RESTful API framework (e.g., Flask, Django, or FastAPI).
* Implement Basic CRUD Endpoints:
* Develop endpoints for Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for expenses.
* Write simple tests or use a tool like Postman to verify API endpoints.

## Are there any impediments in your way?
* I am concerned about the feasibility of the setup but I will be able to figure things out 

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* I thought that it went well and has set me up for success
