# Weekly Update #5

## What did you do last week?
* I was trying to complete finals for MBA courses and making small changes to the github site. I do a few things with the project as well such as:
    More debuging and test writing
    Choose and configured my database and worked on operations involved

## Are there any impediments in your way?
* More technical stuff. Getting up to speed on this has been tough

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* Same as last week, continuing to work on one thing at a time to maintain focus and staying organized 

## Plans for this week?
Choosing a library (maybe Chart.js)
Implement basic charts (I'm shooting for a few visualization types: one for expense trends and one for spending category breakdowns)
Attempt to connect charts to the API data
