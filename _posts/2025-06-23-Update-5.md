Visualization Setup:
Choose a library (e.g., Chart.js for simplicity as a mitigation strategy over D3.js).
Implement Basic Charts:
Create at least two visualization types: one for expense trends and one for spending category breakdowns.
Data Integration:
Connect charts to the API data, even if using mock data initially.
