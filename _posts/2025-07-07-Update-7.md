# Weekly Update #7

## What did you do last week? 
Feature Scope for Analytics:
Implemented a 30â€‘day cash flow forecast using simple time series forecasting (e.g., moving average or linear regression).
Develop Predictive Module:
Implemented the initial version of the forecasting logic using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy).
Testing with Mock Data:
Validated the forecast on sample data that was created.

## Are there any impediments in your way?
* More technical stuff. More testing 

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* Same as last week, continuing to work on one thing at a time to maintain focus and staying organized 

## Plans for this week?
Refinement of Forecasting:
Fine-tune the model to meet the performance goal (e.g., MAE < $100 on test data).
Integration into Dashboard:
Display the cash flow forecast within the dashboard UI.
Simulated Deployments & Evaluation:
Test the end-to-end flow with fake and then more realistic data to see how predictions reflect expense trends.
