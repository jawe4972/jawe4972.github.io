# Weekly Update #3

## What did you do last week?
* I looked at the Data Models & API Framework and created categories for further study
* I set up a flask based framework to run the project
* I worked on creating endpoints for the simple operations for expenses

## What do you plan to do this week?
* I will write simple tests verify the endpoints

## Are there any impediments in your way?
* Creating the tests/debug the application 

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* I think I am off to a good start but this week will be one of my tougher weeks from a technical standpoint
