# Weekly Update #10

## What did you do last week? 
Docker Containerization 
Containerize the Application:
Wrote Dockerfiles for both backend and frontend.
Testing the Container:
Run the containers locally and ensure that the app runs as expected (still needs more testing).
Debug & Document Container Setup:
Make sure to capture common issues and steps in the documentation.
More and more testing 

## Are there any impediments in your way?
* More technical stuff. More testing 

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* Same as last week, continuing to work on one thing at a time to maintain focus and staying organized 

## Plans for this week?
Write Comprehensive Documentation:
Document the project architecture, API endpoints, and instructions for setup/deployment.
Include guidelines on using the predictive analytics and dashboard features.
Implement Testing:
Write unit tests for critical components (CRUD operations, predictive module, authentication).
Create basic integration tests to ensure end-to-end flow.
Review & Refine:
Go through the documentation and code to verify clarity and completeness.
