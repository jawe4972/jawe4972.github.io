# Weekly Update #9

## What did you do last week? 
Docker Containerization 
Containerize the Application:
Write Dockerfiles for both backend and frontend.
Optionally, create a docker-compose file to orchestrate multi‑container setup (backend, frontend, DB).
Testing the Container:
Run the containers locally and ensure that the app runs as expected.
Debug & Document Container Setup:
Make sure to capture common issues and steps in the documentation.
More and more testing 

## Are there any impediments in your way?
* More technical stuff. More testing 

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* Same as last week, continuing to work on one thing at a time to maintain focus and staying organized 

## Plans for this week?
