# Weekly Update #12

## What did you do last week? 
Completely simplified the project since I was unable to make the web browser work consistently 

## Are there any impediments in your way?
* More technical stuff 

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* Same as last week, continuing to work on one thing at a time to maintain focus and staying organized 

## Plans for this week?
Finishing the final product for it to be at least presentable
