# Weekly Update #9

## What did you do last week? 
Authentication Implementation:
Attempted to implement secure user authentication (session-based).
Added endpoints for user registration and login.
Integrate with Existing Modules:
Made some expense tracking and forecasting endpoints moderately functional.
Security Testing:
More testing to see how secure data was handled.

## Are there any impediments in your way?
* More technical stuff. More testing 

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* Same as last week, continuing to work on one thing at a time to maintain focus and staying organized 

## Plans for this week?
Authentication Implementation:
Implement secure user authentication (choose JWT or session-based).
Add endpoints for user registration and login.
Integrate with Existing Modules:
Ensure that expense tracking and forecasting endpoints require authentication.
Security Testing:
Do some basic testing (and maybe code reviews) to verify secure data handling.
