## What did you do last week?
* Last week was a tough one because of the holidays and just getting things organized to start the project. I have decided that I would like to do something that is    related to finance and stock market futures as this will go along nicely with the classes that I am taking for my MBA.

## What do you plan to do this week?
* I plan on honing in on what exactly I would like to study and what angle I would like to approach it

## Are there any impediments in your way?
* The biggest hurdle will be my knowledge base. There is a great deal of the info that is available so it will be important for me to determine if the info is quality or     not. 

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* I just need to take all of the data in small batches rather than trying to do the whole set at once. I had analysis paralysis and accomplished less because I felt overwhelmed. This will improve with time and I am confident that I will be happy with the result.
