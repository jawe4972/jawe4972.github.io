# Weekly Update #8

## What did you do last week? 
Refinement of Forecasting:
Fine-tuned the model to meet the performance goal (e.g., MAE < $100 on test data).
Integration into Dashboard:
Worked on the cash flow forecast display within the dashboard UI.
Simulated Deployments & Evaluation:
Tested the end-to-end flow with fake and then more realistic data to see how predictions reflect expense trends.

## Are there any impediments in your way?
* More technical stuff. More testing 

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* Same as last week, continuing to work on one thing at a time to maintain focus and staying organized 

## Plans for this week?
Authentication Implementation:
Implement secure user authentication (choose JWT or session-based).
Add endpoints for user registration and login.
Integrate with Existing Modules:
Ensure that expense tracking and forecasting endpoints require authentication.
Security Testing:
Do some basic testing (and maybe code reviews) to verify secure data handling.
