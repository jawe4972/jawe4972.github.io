## What did you do last week?
* It was a tough week. I struggled with coming up with tests and debugging of the application so I decided to put it down and rehash some of the programming skills to she how I could improve things. I get better towards the end of the week 

## What do you plan to do this week?
* Continue with debug/test writing
* Choosing and configuring my database
* Integrate database operations within the API
* Ensure that the CRUD operations are fully connected to the database
* Add basic input validation and error handling for API endpoints.

## Are there any impediments in your way?
* Another technical week, so making sure that everything is working close to its intended purpose

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* Continuing to work on one thing at a time to maintain focus and staying organized
